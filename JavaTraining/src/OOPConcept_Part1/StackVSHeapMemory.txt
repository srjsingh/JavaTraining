#Java Memory Management

-->Stack:
1. Follows LIFO order
2. Object reference variable, non static methods, local variables are stored here.
3. Memory life is till current method
4.Faster than heap
5. Automatically allocation is done(Method is called and returned)

-->HEAP:
1.have sub memory --> Young generation,  EDEN, Survivor1, Survivor2 etc
2.Object are created in heap and copy of class instance var is store in heap 
3.Object are created in EDEN first
4. when EDEN is full and minor garbage collector comes to clear space then EDEN transfer objects to Survivor1
5. minor garbage collector destroys object with no object reference only.
6. Memory life is Application/Program execution
7. Slower
8. Allocation will happen when object is created and deallocation happens when garbage collector called and only no reference object or null reference object are destroyed

-->Permanent Generation(name before JDK 8)
1. Stores only Static value/methods
2.Size was fixed

Meta space(After JDK 8)
1. Size was dynamic
2.Operate on native OS
3. Common Memory Allocation concept
